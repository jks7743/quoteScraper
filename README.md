# quote_scraper
This is a web-scraper application for future use in [OKrammus](https://github.com/htmercury/OKrammus). This python script scrapes the [League of Legends wikia](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Wiki) for champion information and builds a list of dictionaries containing champion: Names, Links, Quotes, and Images. The dictionary also includes a prettified version of each champions name.


This repo includes seperate scraper and upload scripts
* Uses Beautifulsoup4, requests, html5lib, gpspread, time, and oauth2client libraries
* Requires Google Spreadsheets API credentials (this script accounts for default read and write limitations)

## Getting Started
//TODO

## Planned Features
* Find a way more efficient way to scrape data and update the database
* Quote filters?
